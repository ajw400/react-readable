# Readable API Server

This project is a simple posting and commenting app using redux. Users can post in predefined categories, comment on their posts, upvote and downvote both posts and comments, and manage posts and comments with edit and delete functionality.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server and the frontend react app. Both should be run simultaneously.

## Start

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, start the front-end
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm start`

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
